DashBoard
This project is an Excel dashboard built from a RedBus ticket booking dataset. It shows key details like seat availability, ticket prices and route information in a clear and organized way. The dashboard was created using pivot tables, charts and slicers so anyone can explore the data quickly. It helps you compare sleeper and non-sleeper seats, check how prices change with distance and understand which routes are more active. The goal is to make the dataset easy to read and give a simple view of how RedBus bookings look across different routes and bus types.
